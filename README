NAME
    Solution - A Simple, Stateless Template System

Synopsis
        use Solution;

        my $template = Solution::Template->new( );
        $template->parse( # See Solution::Tag for more
            '{%for x in (1..3) reversed %}{{x}}, {%endfor%}{{some.text}}'
        );
        print $template->render( { some => { text => 'Contact!' } } );

Description
    Solution is a template engine based on Liquid. The Liquid template
    engine was crafted for very specific requirements:

    *   It has to have simple markup and beautiful results. Template engines
        which don't produce good looking results are no fun to use.

    *   It needs to be non-evaling and secure. Liquid templates are made so
        that users can edit them. You don't want to run code on your server
        which your users wrote.

    *   It has to be stateless. The compile and render steps have to be
        separate, so that the expensive parsing and compiling can be done
        once; later on, you can just render it by passing in a hash with
        local variables and objects.

    *   It needs to be able to style emails as well as HTML.

Getting Started
    It's very simple to get started with Solution. Just as in Liquid,
    templates are built and used in two steps: Parse and Render.

    For an overview of the Liquid/Solution syntax, please read Liquid for
    Designers (it's linked to in the See Also section below).

        # Parses and compiles the template
        my $template = Solution::Template->parse('Hi, {{name}}!');

        # Renders the output => "Hi, Sanko!"
        $template->render({ name => 'Sanko' });

    The "parse" step creates a fully compiled template which can be re-used
    as often as you like. You can store it in memory or in a cache for
    faster rendering later.

    All parameters you want Solution to work with have to be passed as
    parameters to the render method. Solution is a closed ecosystem; it does
    not know about your local, instance, and global variables.

    For more, see Solution::Tag.

Why should I use Solution?
    *   You want to allow your users to edit the appearance of your
        application, but don't want them to run insecure code on your
        server.

    *   You want to render templates directly from the database.

    *   You like Smarty-style template engines.

    *   You need a template engine which does HTML just as well as emails.

    *   You don't like the markup language of your current template engine.

    *   You wasted three days reinventing this wheel when you could have
        been doing something productive like volunteering or catching up on
        past seasons of *Doctor Who*.

Why shouldn't I use Solution?
    *   You've found or written your own template engine which fills your
        needs better than Liquid or Solution ever could.

        Psst! Hey, if you haven't found it yet, check the See Also section.

    *   You are uncomfortable with text that you didn't copy and paste
        yourself. Everyone knows computers cannot be trusted.

Ugh! Why a new Top Level Namespace?
    I really don't have a good reason but I promise to send myself to bed
    without dinner as punishment.

    As I understand it, the original project's name, Liquid, is a reference
    to the classical states of matter (the engine itself being stateless). I
    settled on Solution because it's Liquid but... with... bits of other
    stuff floating in it. Pretend you majored in chemistry instead of
    mathematics or computer science and you'll know what I mean.

    This 'solution' is not the answer to all your problems. ...I'll even go
    ahead and say it's not the best solution for your templating problems.
    It's simply *a* solution.

  Other Template Engines
    *   The Template Toolkit is the granddaddy of all Perl based template
        engines.

    *   ...which would make Template::Tiny the weird uncle.

    *Note: This list is obviously incomplete.*
